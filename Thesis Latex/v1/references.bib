  Abstract                 = {We propose a new language called Precision Timed C (PRET-C), for predictable and lightweight multi-threading in C. PRET-C supports synchronous concurrency, preemption, and a high-level construct for logical time. In contrast to existing synchronous languages, PRET-C offers C-based shared memory communications between concurrent threads that is guaranteed to be thread safe. Due to the proposed synchronous semantics, the mapping of logical time to physical time can be achieved much more easily than with plain C, thanks to a Worst Case Reaction Time (WCRT) analyzer (not presented here). Associated to the PRET-C programming language, we present a dedicated target architecture, called ARPRET, which combines a hardware accelerator associated to an existing softcore processor. This allows us to improve the throughput while preserving the predictability. With extensive benchmarking, we then demonstrate that ARPRET not only achieves completely predictable execution of PRET-C programs, but also improves the throughput when compared to the pure software execution of PRET-C. The PRET-C software approach is also significantly more efficient in comparison to two other light-weight concurrent C variants (namely SC and Protothreads), as well as the well-known Esterel synchronous programming language.},

  Abstract                 = {Failures in complex systems controlled by human operators can be difficult to anticipate because of unexpected interactions between the elements that compose the system, including human-automation interaction (HAI). HAI analyses would benefit from techniques that support investigating the possible combinations of system conditions and HAIs that might result in failures. Formal verification is a powerful technique used to mathematically prove that an appropriately scaled model of a system does or does not exhibit desirable properties. This paper discusses how formal verification has been used to evaluate HAI. It has been used to evaluate human-automation interfaces for usability properties and to find potential mode confusion. It has also been used to evaluate system safety properties in light of formally modeled task analytic human behavior. While capable of providing insights into problems associated with HAI, formal verification does not scale as well as other techniques such as simulation. However, advances in formal verification continue to address this problem, and approaches that allow it to complement more traditional analysis methods can potentially avoid this limitation.},

It uses a portion of an aircraft vehicle management system (VMS), specifically the fuel management subsystem, to illustrate the challenges, and then discusses technologies that at least partially address the challenges. Specific technologies described include hybrid system modeling and simulation, concurrent and heterogeneous models of computation, the use of domain-specific ontologies to enhance modularity, and the joint modeling of functionality and implementation architectures.},

  Abstract                 = {The IEC 61499 standard has become one of the key approaches to building distributed component-based control systems in industrial automation. The problem of adoption of this standard in industrial practice is often associated with incompletely defined semantics of functional blocks (FB), which are main design artifacts of the standard. In this paper we propose formal (operational) semantics of IEC 61499 FB using transition systems (by example of FB systems operating in accordance with the cyclic execution model). The proposed FB operational semantics is most convenient for the formal verification of FB systems on the basis of model checking as it describes the direct transitions between states. A limitation of this approach is the need to map hierarchical FB systems to flat models. The technique of code generation used for transforming FB transition systems to SMV models is briefly discussed followed by a simple case study.},

This paper addresses this problem by presenting a programming model called programming temporally integrated distributed embedded systems (PTIDES) that serves as a coordination language for model-based design of distributed real-time embedded systems. Specifically, the paper describes the principles of PTIDES, which leverages network time synchronization to provide a determinate distributed real-time semantics. We show how PTIDES can function as a coordination language, orchestrating components that may be designed and specified using different formalisms. We show the use of this environment in the design of interesting and practical cyber-physical systems, such as a power plant control system.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern embedded computing systems tend to be
 heterogeneous in the sense of being composed of
 subsystems with very different characteristics,
 which communicate and interact in a variety of
 ways-synchronous or asynchronous, buffered or
 unbuffered, etc. Obviously, when designing such
 systems, a modeling language needs to reflect this
 heterogeneity. Today's modeling environments
 usually offer a variant of what we call amorphous
 heterogeneity to address this problem. This paper
 argues that modeling systems in this manner leads
 to unexpected and hard-to-analyze interactions
 between the communication mechanisms and proposes
 a more structured approach to heterogeneity,
 called hierarchical heterogeneity, to solve this
 problem. It proposes a model structure and
 semantic framework that support this form of
 heterogeneity, and discusses the issues arising
 from heterogeneous component interaction and the
 desire for component reuse. It introduces the
 notion of domain polymorphism as a way to address
 these issues.},

  Abstract                 = {Current industrial applications demand the design of more and more complex, safe and trustworthy control systems exhibiting a high degree of flexibility and reutilization. To achieve this, the engineering process should be improved by making the engineering tools involved in the development process to collaborate during the design. This paper presents a model-based approach for designing complex automation applications. The core of the approach is constituted by a set of domain specific models that depend on the application field and whose elements, syntax and semantics are defined from the point of view of the experts that participate in the design of the system. The domain models are defined using engineering tools as the design progresses and they can be used to achieve tool integration through model collaboration. This can be achieved following the Model Driven Engineering approach by means of model transformations. This paper specifically focuses on the first step of this paradigm: the definition of domain languages, in this case for industrial control systems, as well as validation mechanisms of application designs coming from different domain tools. Three well known and widely used industrial standards have been used: Computer Aided Engineering eXchange (CAEX), PLCopen (a representation format for the IEC 61131-3 standard) and MathML (a language for defining mathematical constraints). Using model checking it is possible to assure the correctness of the control system specification and using model transformation it is possible to detect design errors in early stages of the design.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an applicative language, SIGNAL, designed to program real-time systems. The language is based on a synchronous notion of time. We assume the execution of operations to have a zero logical time duration; then, the sequence of communication events determines entirely a temporal reference. The ordering of the runable operations is limited only by the dependencies between the calculi : this is the point of view of data flow languages. SIGNAL is a data flow language (where the potential parallelism is implicit), which permits a structural description of interconnected processes. SIGNAL handles possibly infinite sequences of values (called signals) characterized by an implicit clock which specifies the relative instants (with respect to other signals) at which these values are available. Specific operators, such as delay, undersampling, deterministic merge, are designed to express temporal relations between different signals : in this way, a SIGNAL program expresses both functional and temporal relationships between all the involved signals. The language is semantically sound, and its declarative style allows to derive, by a simple projection on the commutative field Z/3Z, a complete static calculus of the timing of any SIGNAL process, called its clock calculus. Hence, the language SIGNAL is also a formal system to reason about timing and concurrency. The clock calculus is completed together with the dependency analysis of a given program. This leads to a conditional dependence graph in which the edges may be labelled by the involved clocks. From this graph, we generate code for a sequential machine, but it appears to be the suitable level to study the implementation on a multiprocessor architecture.},

  Abstract                 = {As the design complexity of cyber-physical systems continues to grow, modeling the system at higher abstraction levels with formal models of computation is increasingly appealing since it enables early design verification and analysis. One of the most important aspects in system modeling and analysis is timing. However, it is very challenging to analyze and verify timing at the early design stages, as the design representation is quite abstract and trade-offs have to be made between the performance requirements defined in terms of system functionality and the cost of the feasible architecture that can implement the functionality. In this paper, we present Metronomy, a function-architecture co-simulation framework that integrates functional modeling from Ptolemy and architectural modeling from the MetroII environment via a mapping interface. Metronomy exploits contract theory for timing verification and design space exploration via co-simulation. Two case studies on an electrical power system and a paper-feed sub-system for a high speed printing press demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  Abstract                 = {The IEC 61499 is an international standard for describing industrial process-control systems. Such systems typically consist of embedded computers that interact closely with physical processes within a feedback loop. In order to correctly control these physical processes, computations in response to inputs need to be done in a timely manner. A program's worst-case reaction time (WCRT) to inputs is usually used to ensure that timing constraints are met. Unfortunately, the standard has no provisions for specifying real-time constraints. Moreover, typical implementations of IEC 61499 are tightly coupled to their runtime environments-each with possibly different semantics and temporal properties-which makes it difficult to automate the estimation of their WCRTs. We propose to adopt a synchronous model for IEC 61499 programs. This allows the programs to be executed without the need of a run-time environment. Consequently, we are able to use a novel model-checking technique to estimate the WCRT of IEC 61499 programs. Experimental results on a suite of programs show that this approach provides conservative estimates that are, on average, less than 10 percent off from the actual WCRT.},

  Abstract                 = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general- purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.},

  Abstract                 = {The IEC 61499 standard provides an executable model for distributed control systems in terms of interacting function blocks. However, the current IEC 61499 standard lacks appropriate timing semantics for the specification of timing requirements, reasoning on timing properties at the model level, and for the timing verification of a specific deployment. In this paper we address this fundamental shortcoming by proposing Real-Time-4-FUN, a real-time semantics for IEC 61499. The key property is the preservation of non-determinism, allowing us to reason on (and verify) timing properties at the model level without assuming any specific scheduling policy or stipulating specific order of execution for the deployment. This provides for a clear separation of concerns, where the designer can focus on properties of the application prior to, and separately from, deployment verification. The proposed timing semantics is backwards compatible to the current standard, thus allow for reuse of existing designs. The transitional property allows timing requirements to propagate to downstream sub-systems, and can be utilized for scheduling both at device and network level. Based on a translation to RTFM-tasks and resources, IEC 61499 models can be analyzed, compiled and executed. As a proof of concept the timing semantics has been experimentally implemented in the RTFM-core language and the accompanying (thread based) RTFM-RT run-time system.},

The PTARM employs a repeatable thread-interleaved pipeline with an exposed memory hierarchy, including a repeatable DRAM controller. Our benchmarks show an improved throughput compared to a single-threaded in-order five-stage pipeline, given sufficient parallelism in the software.},

  Abstract                 = {Time-driven and event-driven control models are two fundamental design paradigms applied in distributed control systems for synchronizing decentralized activities. This paper proposes a unified architecture for combining both approaches. The combination offers the best of both worlds' properties, such as the expressiveness of event-driven programming and the determinism of time-driven logic. The foundations of this symbiosis are the IEC 61499 Function Block standard providing event-driven distributed control architecture and the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol establishing the basis for highly-accurate time synchronization. The proposed time-complemented event-driven distributed control model aims at improving the modularity and flexibility of automation software with satisfactory control performance. The new control model has been compared with conventional centralized and distributed control approaches analytically and by simulation. The comparison results reveal that the proposed control model is efficient and flexible. Finally, a reference example has been used to demonstrate merits of the new approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Embedded systems are typically heterogeneous requiring interacting hardware and software components, are locally synchronous while being globally asynchronous and combine both control and data dominated blocks. Conventional architectures and hardware–software platforms do not directly support such heterogeneity leading to complex design flow and verification process for such systems. This paper presents a new architecture for heterogeneous embedded systems called HiDRA based on multiple reactive processor cores. The architecture supports globally asynchronous locally synchronous systems with a mix of data-dominated and control-dominated behaviors. The reactive processor cores implement Esterel-like computation with architectural support for signal polling, emission and preemption. HiDRA also provides primitives for communication and synchronization between concurrent processes. A low level (concurrent reactive assembly) language has been specified to model embedded applications, which are executable directly on the HiDRA platform. The first implementations with up to four reactive processors have been done on the standard FPGAs. Performance comparison with a typical application realized from system level language \{ECL\} reveals significant speedup and reduction in code size. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Real-time systems need time-predictable platforms to allow static analysis of the worst-case execution time (WCET). Standard multi-core processors are optimized for the average case and are hardly analyzable. Within the T-CREST project we propose novel solutions for time-predictable multi-core architectures that are optimized for the \{WCET\} instead of the average-case execution time. The resulting time-predictable resources (processors, interconnect, memory arbiter, and memory controller) and tools (compiler, \{WCET\} analysis) are designed to ease \{WCET\} analysis and to optimize \{WCET\} performance. Compared to other processors the \{WCET\} performance is outstanding. The T-CREST platform is evaluated with two industrial use cases. An application from the avionic domain demonstrates that tasks executing on different cores do not interfere with respect to their WCET. A signal processing application from the railway domain shows that the \{WCET\} can be reduced for computation-intensive tasks when distributing the tasks on several cores and using the network-on-chip for communication. With three cores the \{WCET\} is improved by a factor of 1.8 and with 15 cores by a factor of 5.7. The T-CREST project is the result of a collaborative research and development project executed by eight partners from academia and industry. The European Commission funded T-CREST. },

The proposed approach is based on the distributed reference architecture of IEC 61499 standard enhanced with a time-stamping mechanism. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach complements the abilities of IEC 61499 to maintain correct causality of distributed system execution with improved performance of physical system property called cyber-physical agnosticism. The time-stamped event semantics of IEC 61499 is introduced and mapped to the PTIDES execution model of Ptolemy II. We have experimentally validated that changing the model of computation in distributed automation to a time-stamped event-driven one can bring substantial improvements in flexibility and reconfigurability of cyber-physical automation systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Multicore processors provide better power-performance trade-offs compared to single-core processors. Consequently, they are rapidly penetrating market segments which are both safety critical and hard real-time in nature. However, designing time-predictable embedded applications over multicores remains a considerable challenge. This paper proposes the ForeC language for the deterministic parallel programming of embedded applications on multicores. ForeC extends C with a minimal set of constructs adopted from synchronous languages. To guarantee the worst-case performance of ForeC programs, we offer a very precise reachability-based timing analyzer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the efficient and deterministic parallel programming of multicores using a synchronous C-variant. Experimentation with large multicore programs revealed an average over-estimation of only 2% for the computed worst-case execution times (WCETs). By reducing our representation of the program's state-space, we reduced the analysis time for the largest program (with 43, 695 reachable states) by a factor of 342, to only 7 seconds.},

  Abstract                 = {IEC 61499 is a standard for designing industrial control systems using function blocks. Since its publication in 2005, several run-time environments have been developed as plausible implementations. Most of them, however, are poorly suited for use in safety-critical systems, as they are unable to guarantee deterministic behaviour and predictable timing. The use of different run-time environments results in subtle behavioural differences and complicates the effort of static timing analysis. We offer an alternative solution by leveraging the model-based approach to automatically synthesize multirate synchronous programs for a multitasking environment. Our approach preserves the well-known deterministic property of synchronous programs, while facilitating static timing analysis of IEC 61499 specifications. We achieve this without the need to introduce any foreign artefact to the standard. The schedulability criterion for tasks derived using our technique is given for the rate-monotonic scheduling policy. The viability of our approach is demonstrated through a code generator, which synthesizes multirate synchronous code for multi-task execution on the muC/OS-II real-time operating system.},

  Abstract                 = {Current trends in the manufacturing sector have greatly increased the need for portability and reusability in software systems for industrial control and automation. The IEC 61499 standard has emerged out of this need for a platform-independent way to develop industrial control systems. So far, typical IEC 61499 solutions have relied on some run-time environment that differ in the execution model for each implementation. This has resulted in code that is neither portable, nor efficient in terms of execution speed and memory footprint. Therefore, we present, instead, a synchronous model for function blocks, which removes the need for a run-time environment by making all event scheduling decisions during compile-time. This approach has been used to create a function block compiler, with two different back-end code generators. We present experimental results of a benchmark suite implemented using different code generators for different execution models, and show that our technique yields significant gains in efficiency over existing approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {IEC 61499 has been endorsed as the standard for modeling and implementing distributed industrial process measurement and control systems. The standard prescribes the use of function blocks for designing systems in a component-oriented approach. The execution model of a basic function block and the manner for event/data connections between blocks are described therein. Unfortunately, the standard does not provide exhaustive specifications for function block execution. Consequently, multiple standard-compliant implementations exhibiting different behaviors are possible. This not only defeats the purpose of having a standard but also makes verification of function block systems difficult. To overcome this, we propose synchronous semantics for function blocks and show its feasibility by translating function blocks into a subset of Esterel, a well-known synchronous language. The proposed semantics avoids causal cycles common in Esterel and is proved to be reactive and deterministic under any composition. Moreover, verification techniques developed for synchronous systems can now be applied to function blocks.},

  Abstract                 = {Esterel programs have traditionally been compiled to software code for general purpose processors or to hardware netlists. This paper, instead, proposes a reactive processor for the direct execution of Esterel. This intermediate approach offers the same flexibility as software compilation, while at the same time, providing much better code size and execution time. The proposed architecture, called STARPro, is a pipelined, multithreaded, reactive processor that provides native support for the direct execution of Esterel. \{STARPro\} manages Esterel threads and their scheduling, and also features a hardware preemption unit to assist the handling of the abort constructs in Esterel. In addition to the proposed architecture, we have also developed a new intermediate format called \{UCCFGsd\} (unrolled concurrent control-flow graph with surface and depth) to represent the structure of an Esterel program in our compiler. \{UCCFGsd\} closely resembles the Esterel source, and it has also been designed with Esterel hardware support in mind, allowing a straight forward translation into \{STARPro\} assembly instructions. We have compared the performance of \{STARPro\} against a recent reactive architecture and found an average of 37% speed-up in worst-case reaction times, and 38% in average-case reaction times. },

High-criticality tasks require spatial and temporal isolation guarantees for independent verification, and the task set should efficiently utilize hardware resources. Hardware-based isolation is desirable but often underutilizes hardware resources, which can consist of multiple single-core, multicore, or multithreaded processors. We present FlexPRET, a processor designed specifically for mixed-criticality systems by allowing each task to make a trade-off between hardware-based isolation and efficient processor utilization. FlexPRET uses fine-grained multithreading with flexible scheduling and timing instructions to provide this functionality.},

	Abstract                 = {The IEC 61499 standard provides an executable model for distributed control systems in terms of interacting function blocks. However, the current IEC 61499 standard lacks appropriate timing semantics for the specification of timing requirements, reasoning on timing properties at the model level, and for the timing verification of a specific deployment. In this paper we address this fundamental shortcoming by proposing Real-Time-4-FUN, a real-time semantics for IEC 61499. The key property is the preservation of non-determinism, allowing us to reason on (and verify) timing properties at the model level without assuming any specific scheduling policy or stipulating specific order of execution for the deployment. This provides for a clear separation of concerns, where the designer can focus on properties of the application prior to, and separately from, deployment verification. The proposed timing semantics is backwards compatible to the current standard, thus allow for reuse of existing designs. The transitional property allows timing requirements to propagate to downstream sub-systems, and can be utilized for scheduling both at device and network level. Based on a translation to RTFM-tasks and resources, IEC 61499 models can be analyzed, compiled and executed. As a proof of concept the timing semantics has been experimentally implemented in the RTFM-core language and the accompanying (thread based) RTFM-RT run-time system.},

Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general- purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.},

Specifically, the paper describes the principles of PTIDES, which leverages network time synchronization to provide a determinate distributed real-time semantics. We show how PTIDES can function as a coordination language, orchestrating components that may be designed and specified using different formalisms. We show the use of this environment in the design of interesting and practical cyber-physical systems, such as a power plant control system.},

The IEC 61499 standard has emerged out of this need for a platform-independent way to develop industrial control systems. So far, typical IEC 61499 solutions have relied on some run-time environment that differ in the execution model for each implementation. This has resulted in code that is neither portable, nor efficient in terms of execution speed and memory footprint. Therefore, we present, instead, a synchronous model for function blocks, which removes the need for a run-time environment by making all event scheduling decisions during compile-time. This approach has been used to create a function block compiler, with two different back-end code generators. We present experimental results of a benchmark suite implemented using different code generators for different execution models, and show that our technique yields significant gains in efficiency over existing approaches.},

High-criticality tasks require spatial and temporal isolation guarantees for independent verification, and the task set should efficiently utilize hardware resources. Hardware-based isolation is desirable but often underutilizes hardware resources, which can consist of multiple single-core, multicore, or multithreaded processors. We present FlexPRET, a processor designed specifically for mixed-criticality systems by allowing each task to make a trade-off between hardware-based isolation and efficient processor utilization. FlexPRET uses fine-grained multithreading with flexible scheduling and timing instructions to provide this functionality.},

HAI analyses would benefit from techniques that support investigating the possible combinations of system conditions and HAIs that might result in failures. Formal verification is a powerful technique used to mathematically prove that an appropriately scaled model of a system does or does not exhibit desirable properties. This paper discusses how formal verification has been used to evaluate HAI. It has been used to evaluate human-automation interfaces for usability properties and to find potential mode confusion. It has also been used to evaluate system safety properties in light of formally modeled task analytic human behavior. While capable of providing insights into problems associated with HAI, formal verification does not scale as well as other techniques such as simulation. However, advances in formal verification continue to address this problem, and approaches that allow it to complement more traditional analysis methods can potentially avoid this limitation.},

Conventional architectures and hardware–software platforms do not directly support such heterogeneity leading to complex design flow and verification process for such systems. This paper presents a new architecture for heterogeneous embedded systems called HiDRA based on multiple reactive processor cores. The architecture supports globally asynchronous locally synchronous systems with a mix of data-dominated and control-dominated behaviors. The reactive processor cores implement Esterel-like computation with architectural support for signal polling, emission and preemption. HiDRA also provides primitives for communication and synchronization between concurrent processes. A low level (concurrent reactive assembly) language has been specified to model embedded applications, which are executable directly on the HiDRA platform. The first implementations with up to four reactive processors have been done on the standard FPGAs. Performance comparison with a typical application realized from system level language \{ECL\} reveals significant speedup and reduction in code size. },

The proposed approach is based on the distributed reference architecture of IEC 61499 standard enhanced with a time-stamping mechanism. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach complements the abilities of IEC 61499 to maintain correct causality of distributed system execution with improved performance of physical system property called cyber-physical agnosticism. The time-stamped event semantics of IEC 61499 is introduced and mapped to the PTIDES execution model of Ptolemy II. We have experimentally validated that changing the model of computation in distributed automation to a time-stamped event-driven one can bring substantial improvements in flexibility and reconfigurability of cyber-physical automation systems.},

The problem of adoption of this standard in industrial practice is often associated with incompletely defined semantics of functional blocks (FB), which are main design artifacts of the standard. In this paper we propose formal (operational) semantics of IEC 61499 FB using transition systems (by example of FB systems operating in accordance with the cyclic execution model). The proposed FB operational semantics is most convenient for the formal verification of FB systems on the basis of model checking as it describes the direct transitions between states. A limitation of this approach is the need to map hierarchical FB systems to flat models. The technique of code generation used for transforming FB transition systems to SMV models is briefly discussed followed by a simple case study.},

In particular it is shown that networks of spiking neurons are, with regard to the number of neurons that are needed, computationally more powerful than these other neural network models. A concrete biologically relevant function is exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net. On the other hand, it is known that any function that can be computed by a small sigmoidal neural net can also be computed by a small network of spiking neurons. This article does not assume prior knowledge about spiking neurons, and it contains an extensive list of references to the currently available literature on computations in networks of spiking neurons and relevant results from neurobiology.},

One of the most important aspects in system modeling and analysis is timing. However, it is very challenging to analyze and verify timing at the early design stages, as the design representation is quite abstract and trade-offs have to be made between the performance requirements defined in terms of system functionality and the cost of the feasible architecture that can implement the functionality. In this paper, we present Metronomy, a function-architecture co-simulation framework that integrates functional modeling from Ptolemy and architectural modeling from the MetroII environment via a mapping interface. Metronomy exploits contract theory for timing verification and design space exploration via co-simulation. Two case studies on an electrical power system and a paper-feed sub-system for a high speed printing press demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

	Abstract                 = {Current industrial applications demand the design of more and more complex, safe and trustworthy control systems exhibiting a high degree of flexibility and reutilization. To achieve this, the engineering process should be improved by making the engineering tools involved in the development process to collaborate during the design. This paper presents a model-based approach for designing complex automation applications. The core of the approach is constituted by a set of domain specific models that depend on the application field and whose elements, syntax and semantics are defined from the point of view of the experts that participate in the design of the system. The domain models are defined using engineering tools as the design progresses and they can be used to achieve tool integration through model collaboration. This can be achieved following the Model Driven Engineering approach by means of model transformations. This paper specifically focuses on the first step of this paradigm: the definition of domain languages, in this case for industrial control systems, as well as validation mechanisms of application designs coming from different domain tools. Three well known and widely used industrial standards have been used: Computer Aided Engineering eXchange (CAEX), PLCopen (a representation format for the IEC 61131-3 standard) and MathML (a language for defining mathematical constraints). Using model checking it is possible to assure the correctness of the control system specification and using model transformation it is possible to detect design errors in early stages of the design.},

PRET-C supports synchronous concurrency, preemption, and a high-level construct for logical time. In contrast to existing synchronous languages, PRET-C offers C-based shared memory communications between concurrent threads that is guaranteed to be thread safe. Due to the proposed synchronous semantics, the mapping of logical time to physical time can be achieved much more easily than with plain C, thanks to a Worst Case Reaction Time (WCRT) analyzer (not presented here). Associated to the PRET-C programming language, we present a dedicated target architecture, called ARPRET, which combines a hardware accelerator associated to an existing softcore processor. This allows us to improve the throughput while preserving the predictability. With extensive benchmarking, we then demonstrate that ARPRET not only achieves completely predictable execution of PRET-C programs, but also improves the throughput when compared to the pure software execution of PRET-C. The PRET-C software approach is also significantly more efficient in comparison to two other light-weight concurrent C variants (namely SC and Protothreads), as well as the well-known Esterel synchronous programming language.},

This book is a comprehensive introduction to the topic that stresses the systematic development of the underlying theory. Starting from simple threshold elements, more advanced topics are introduced, such as multilayer networks, efficient learning methods, recurrent networks, and self-organization. The various branches of neural network theory are interrelated closely and quite often unexpectedly, so the chapters treat the underlying connection between neural models and offer a unified view of the current state of research in the field. The book has been written for anyone interested in understanding artificial neural networks or in learning more about them. The only mathematical tools needed are those learned during the first two years at university. The text contains more than 300 figures to stimulate the intuition of the reader and to illustrate the kinds of computation performed by neural networks. Material from the book has been used successfully for courses in Germany, Austria and the United States.},

WCET tools designed for application program analysis have been applied to analyze RTOS routines by several research groups, but poor WCET estimations have been reported. Timing analysis of real-time systems considering both applications and RTOS has not been fully studied. So we intend to give a survey of related work on WCET analysis of RTOS.

The standard prescribes the use of function blocks for designing systems in a component-oriented approach. The execution model of a basic function block and the manner for event/data connections between blocks are described therein. Unfortunately, the standard does not provide exhaustive specifications for function block execution. Consequently, multiple standard-compliant implementations exhibiting different behaviors are possible. This not only defeats the purpose of having a standard but also makes verification of function block systems difficult. To overcome this, we propose synchronous semantics for function blocks and show its feasibility by translating function blocks into a subset of Esterel, a well-known synchronous language. The proposed semantics avoids causal cycles common in Esterel and is proved to be reactive and deterministic under any composition. Moreover, verification techniques developed for synchronous systems can now be applied to function blocks.},

The use of different run-time environments results in subtle behavioural differences and complicates the effort of static timing analysis. We offer an alternative solution by leveraging the model-based approach to automatically synthesize multirate synchronous programs for a multitasking environment. Our approach preserves the well-known deterministic property of synchronous programs, while facilitating static timing analysis of IEC 61499 specifications. We achieve this without the need to introduce any foreign artefact to the standard. The schedulability criterion for tasks derived using our technique is given for the rate-monotonic scheduling policy. The viability of our approach is demonstrated through a code generator, which synthesizes multirate synchronous code for multi-task execution on the muC/OS-II real-time operating system.},

Standard multi-core processors are optimized for the average case and are hardly analyzable. Within the T-CREST project we propose novel solutions for time-predictable multi-core architectures that are optimized for the \{WCET\} instead of the average-case execution time. The resulting time-predictable resources (processors, interconnect, memory arbiter, and memory controller) and tools (compiler, \{WCET\} analysis) are designed to ease \{WCET\} analysis and to optimize \{WCET\} performance. Compared to other processors the \{WCET\} performance is outstanding. The T-CREST platform is evaluated with two industrial use cases. An application from the avionic domain demonstrates that tasks executing on different cores do not interfere with respect to their WCET. A signal processing application from the railway domain shows that the \{WCET\} can be reduced for computation-intensive tasks when distributing the tasks on several cores and using the network-on-chip for communication. With three cores the \{WCET\} is improved by a factor of 1.8 and with 15 cores by a factor of 5.7. The T-CREST project is the result of a collaborative research and development project executed by eight partners from academia and industry. The European Commission funded T-CREST. },

The foundations of this symbiosis are the IEC 61499 Function Block standard providing event-driven distributed control architecture and the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol establishing the basis for highly-accurate time synchronization. The proposed time-complemented event-driven distributed control model aims at improving the modularity and flexibility of automation software with satisfactory control performance. The new control model has been compared with conventional centralized and distributed control approaches analytically and by simulation. The comparison results reveal that the proposed control model is efficient and flexible. Finally, a reference example has been used to demonstrate merits of the new approach.},

Consequently, they are rapidly penetrating market segments which are both safety critical and hard real-time in nature. However, designing time-predictable embedded applications over multicores remains a considerable challenge. This paper proposes the ForeC language for the deterministic parallel programming of embedded applications on multicores. ForeC extends C with a minimal set of constructs adopted from synchronous languages. To guarantee the worst-case performance of ForeC programs, we offer a very precise reachability-based timing analyzer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the efficient and deterministic parallel programming of multicores using a synchronous C-variant. Experimentation with large multicore programs revealed an average over-estimation of only 2% for the computed worst-case execution times (WCETs). By reducing our representation of the program's state-space, we reduced the analysis time for the largest program (with 43, 695 reachable states) by a factor of 342, to only 7 seconds.},

Such systems typically consist of embedded computers that interact closely with physical processes within a feedback loop. In order to correctly control these physical processes, computations in response to inputs need to be done in a timely manner. A program's worst-case reaction time (WCRT) to inputs is usually used to ensure that timing constraints are met. Unfortunately, the standard has no provisions for specifying real-time constraints. Moreover, typical implementations of IEC 61499 are tightly coupled to their runtime environments-each with possibly different semantics and temporal properties-which makes it difficult to automate the estimation of their WCRTs. We propose to adopt a synchronous model for IEC 61499 programs. This allows the programs to be executed without the need of a run-time environment. Consequently, we are able to use a novel model-checking technique to estimate the WCRT of IEC 61499 programs. Experimental results on a suite of programs show that this approach provides conservative estimates that are, on average, less than 10 percent off from the actual WCRT.},

By “rigid” we mean “not open to misinterpretation”. Research in formal methods is currently very fashionable. Informal methods are well established in industry. However, no similar methods exist for neural networks. It is tempting to believe that, should a rigid specification method be devised for neural networks, that proving conformance to the specification should be relatively easy when compared with software systems. The justification for this is based in the simplicity of the ANN compared to software, and the availability of appropriate statistical methods. Hierarchical methods for the design of ANNs are not sufficiently advanced. These are highly useful in conventional systems because they allow an initially highly complex design to be partitioned into components. Although an embedded ANN may be considered as a component it is difficult to decompose it into useful subcomponents. Therefore it may remain highly complex and difficult to analyse. The nature of problem domains in which neural networks are applied tend to have ill-defined solutions with respect to formal descriptive techniques, and hence existing verification methods are unlikely to be successful. Instead, more complete methods of testing may be required. Reliability can be attained via standard methods where an ANN is emulated. Additional protection at the computational level is also possible given suitable ANN architectures, hardware and training techniques.},

In particular, the use of Multi Layer Perceptrons, recently enhanced with deep learning capabilities, is proposed. Furthermore, its performance is compared with the most commonly used machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Processes, Regression Trees, Ensemble Boosting and Linear Regression. The analysis of the day-ahead energy prediction demonstrates that different prediction methods present significantly different levels of accuracy in the case of a challenging dataset that comprises an interesting mix of consumers, wind and solar generation. The results show that Multi Layer Perceptrons outperform all the eight methods used as a benchmark in this study.},

	abstract="This study presents the applicability of an ensemble of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and learning paradigms for weather forecasting in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. The proposed ensemble method for weather forecasting has advantages over other techniques like linear combination. Generally, the output of an ensemble is a weighted sum, which are weight-fixed, with the weights being determined from the training or validation data. In the proposed approach, weights are determined dynamically from the respective certainties of the network outputs. The more certain a network seems to be of its decision, the higher the weight. The proposed ensemble model performance is contrasted with multi-layered perceptron network (MLPN), Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN), radial basis function network (RBFN), Hopfield model (HFM) predictive models and regression techniques. The data of temperature, wind speed and relative humidity are used to train and test the different models. With each model, 24-h-ahead forecasts are made for the winter, spring, summer and fall seasons. Moreover, the performance and reliability of the seven models are then evaluated by a number of statistical measures. Among the direct approaches employed, empirical results indicate that HFM is relatively less accurate and RBFN is relatively more reliable for the weather forecasting problem. In comparison, the ensemble of neural networks produced the most accurate forecasts.",

However, a major obstacle in applying them to safety-critical systems is the great difficulty in providing formal guarantees about their behavior. We present a novel, scalable, and efficient technique for verifying properties of deep neural networks (or providing counter-examples). The technique is based on the simplex method, extended to handle the non-convex Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which is a crucial ingredient in many modern neural networks. The verification procedure tackles neural networks as a whole, without making any simplifying assumptions. We evaluated our technique on a prototype deep neural network implementation of the next-generation airborne collision avoidance system for unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). Results show that our technique can successfully prove properties of networks that are an order of magnitude larger than the largest networks verified using existing methods.",

With potential applications including perception modules and end-to-end controllers for self-driving cars, this raises concerns about their safety. We develop a novel automated verification framework for feed-forward multi-layer neural networks based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). We focus on safety of image classification decisions with respect to image manipulations, such as scratches or changes to camera angle or lighting conditions that would result in the same class being assigned by a human, and define safety for an individual decision in terms of invariance of the classification within a small neighbourhood of the original image. We enable exhaustive search of the region by employing discretisation, and propagate the analysis layer by layer. Our method works directly with the network code and, in contrast to existing methods, can guarantee that adversarial examples, if they exist, are found for the given region and family of manipulations. If found, adversarial examples can be shown to human testers and/or used to fine-tune the network. We implement the techniques using Z3 and evaluate them on state-of-the-art networks, including regularised and deep learning networks. We also compare against existing techniques to search for adversarial examples and estimate network robustness.",

	abstract="This paper presents a theory of runtime enforcement based on mechanism models called MRAs (Mandatory Results Automata). MRAs can monitor and transform security-relevant actions and their results. Because previous work could not model monitors transforming results, MRAs capture realistic behaviors outside the scope of previous models. MRAs also have a simple but realistic operational semantics that makes it straightforward to define concrete MRAs. Moreover, the definitions of policies and enforcement with MRAs are significantly simpler and more expressive than those of previous models. Putting all these features together, we argue that MRAs make good general models of runtime mechanisms, upon which a theory of runtime enforcement can be based. We develop some enforceability theory by characterizing the policies MRAs can and cannot enforce.",

	abstract = {Verifying that the behavior of an autonomous systems is safe is fundamental for safety-critical properties like preventing crashes in autonomous vehicles. Unfortunately, exhaustive verification techniques fail to scale to the size of real-life systems. Moreover, these systems frequently use algorithms whose runtime behavior cannot be determined at design time (e.g., machine learning algorithms). This presents another problem given that these algorithms cannot be verified at design time. Fortunately, a technique known as runtime assurance can be used for these cases. The strategy that runtime assurance uses to verify a system is to add small components (known as enforcers) to the system that monitor its output and evaluate whether the output is safe or not. If the output is safe, then the enforcer lets it pass; if the output is unsafe, the enforcer replaces it with a safe output. For instance, in a drone system that must be restricted to fly within a constrained area (a.k.a. geo-fence) an enforcer can be used to monitor the movement commands to the drone. Then, if a movement command keeps the drone within the geo-fence, the enforcer lets it pass, but if the command takes the drone outside of this area, the enforcer replaces it with a safe command (e.g., hovering). Given that enforcers are small components fully specified at design time, it is possible to use exhaustive verification techniques to prove that they can keep the behavior of the whole system safe (e.g., the drone flying within the geo-fence) even if the system contains unverified code.}

In this paper, we extend the model to multiple autonomous systems, and describe the advantages of applying model checking and difficulties. The targeted line tracing robot usually has only one or two sensors to detect a line painted on white background, and it traces the line according to the read value of the sensors. It is easy to trace if the line is simple straight line. However, lines sometimes become complicated by existence of random sequential corners. Those robots are often used in robot competitions for university students in Japan. Driving time, accuracy and robustness are evaluated in such competitions. The robot is usually designed as a stand-alone. Here, we extend such line tracing robots to multiple autonomous robots by adding communication functions and proximity sensors. We consider multiple lines to be crossed where robots might hit each other. Although the introduced model is simple, it has enough power to provide a structure where we can discuss safety and robustness using model checking. Our proposed method can also treat time constraints of robot controls.",

	abstract={One of the key factors which limits the use of neural networks in many industrial applications has been the difficulty of demonstrating that a trained network will continue to generate reliable outputs once it is in routine use. An important potential source of errors is novel input data; that is, input data which differ significantly from the data used to train the network. The author investigates the relationship between the degree of novelty of input data and the corresponding reliability of the outputs from the network. He describes a quantitative procedure for assessing novelty, and demonstrates its performance by using an application which involves monitoring oil flow in multiphase pipelines.<<ETX>>},

	abstract="Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous vehicles or smart power grids, use interactive machine learning modules for decision making. Current design approaches use multiple machine learning modules, often using neural networks, to achieve the desired functionality. Timing validation is performed using measurement-based approaches, which may produce unsound results. To this end, we propose a new approach for designing such systems, by relying on the well known synchronous paradigm. Using this approach, we introduce Synchronous Artificial Neural Networks (SANNs), where we associate logical time to the different operations of the network. This approach provides sound compositional primitives, which enable the composition of interacting neural networks to ensure causality and determinism. We then show that we can embed the generated code on time predictable platforms enabling static analysis. Overall, this paper develops synchronous neural networks implemented in Esterel for the design of time predictable systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by developing a time predictable implementation of several applications, ranging from 5-100+ neurons, realised using the T-CREST platform.	We also implemented a complex Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) application comprising of 1000+ neurons and 16 different layers using Esterel for a soft real-time application. Overall, the developed methodology opens new avenues of research in the direction of time predictable neural networks."

In order to reduce the false-positive rate and the object occlusion problem, which usually happened in camera-based pedestrian detection, we use 3D point cloud returning from Lidar depth sensor to do the further examination on the object's shape. The proposed Lidar/camera sensor fusion design complements the advantage and disadvantage of two sensors such that it is more stable in detection than others. The region proposal is given from both sensors, and candidate from two sensors are also going to the second classification for double checking. It maximums the detection rate and achieves average 99.16% detection accuracy for pedestrian detection.},

Past research in this area has focused on network sensitivity analysis after training. Very few research projects have considered sensitivity analysis as a design issue prior to network implementation. The authors discuss the sensitivity of the most popular and general feedforward networks (multilayer perceptron (MLP)) to its input perturbation. The sensitivity is defined as the mathematical expectation of output errors of the MLP arising from input error with respect to all input and weight values in a given continuous interval. The sensitivity for a single neuron is discussed first, and an analytical expression that is a function of the input error is approximately derived. Then an algorithm is given to compute the sensitivity for an entire MLP network. The theoretical results of the derived formula were shown to agree with experimental results. By analyzing the derived analytical expression and implementing the given algorithm on a number of representative MLP networks, some significant observations on the behavior of sensitivity are discovered, which could be useful for network design consideration.},
