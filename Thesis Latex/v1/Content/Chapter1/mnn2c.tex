\acfp{MBD} is a traditional approach to designing systems~\cite{dmd2019}.
As opposed to design by trial-and-error, \ac{MBD} builds formally defined, safer systems~\cite{dmd2019}.
This approach to creating systems is highly preferred where the safety of the system, e.g. systems that interact with humans, is concerned.
This is relevance where \ac{AI} systems are created that interact with the same environment as humans, such as the \acf{ESS} shown in Section~\ref{sec:ess}.
