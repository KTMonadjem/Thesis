\section{A Case Study for Time Predictable Synchronous Neural Networks}
\subsection{An Energy Storage System for an Electric Vehicle Charging Station}
Cite Kalpesh's paper and describe the system we are using as our case study. 
Why it is unsafe and how we can make it better.

\subsection{Energy Storage System and Machine Learning}
Describe the role of machine learning for the ESS and how the system can be improved.
Describe the training methods used to train the ANNs, and elaborate on how the ANNs work for this system.

\subsection{Synchronous Neural Network in an ESS}
Methodology behind implementing the C and Esterel code for the trained ANN.

\subsection{Timing Analysis of the ESS}
Explain how timing was important for this system and how it can improve the safety of this system.
