\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\acp{CPS} use a set of controllers that are distributed across a network for the 
control of physical processes~\cite{alur2015principles}. \ac{CPS} applications encompass real-time systems, where 
the system needs to satisfy a set of timing requirements to ensure correct operation. Examples include autonomous vehicles and
smart power grids. Here, a missed deadline may result in catastrophic consequences, making these \acp{CPS} highly 
\textit{safety-critical}.
