\section{Runtime Verification of Safe Synchronous Neural Networks}
This section introduces runtime verification of SSNNs with the purpose of dealing with input perturbations.

\subsection{Runtime Enforcement with Input Perturbations}
Explain why generic runtime enforcement is a bad thing. 
This can't work for complex inputs.

\subsection{Combining Runtime Verification and Sensor Fusion for Input Perturbations}
We are introducing a type of RTE called runtime verification.
It does not look to enforce any ANN I/O.
