\section{Introduction}
This chapter discusses the issue of adversarial perturbation~\cite{Gehr2018AI2SA} in \acfp{ANN} and introduces a new method for dealing with these.
We propose the use of reactive \acf{RV}~\cite{runtime-verify} to functionally verify the I/O events of an \ac{ANN} controller at run-time.
Additionally, we use \ac{ANN} ensembles~\cite{Maqsood2004} to passively increase the classification accuracy of an \ac{ANN} controller.
