\section{Discussion}
This chapter presents techniques to increase the safety of \ac{AV} systems. 
The first technique involves creating \ac{MNN} ensembles, consisting of multiple \acp{CNN}, which work together to increase the prediction accuracy.
The second technique uses runtime enforcement to verify the integrity of the \ac{MNN}'s classifications, attempting to detect misclassifications dynamically and put the vehicle in safe state if one is detected.
These two techniques work in tandem to greatly increase the safety of the \ac{AV} system where object misclassification is concerned.

Creating a \ac{MNN}  with three synchronous \acp{CNN}, forming a \ac{MNN} ensemble, did have a large effect on the classification accuracy of the system.
The classification accuracy was higher than that of an ordinary \ac{CNN} regardless of the number of epochs trained, but it was noted that the increase in accuracy was smaller the better trained the ordinary \ac{CNN} was.
This means that using \ac{MNN} ensembles is more effective for poorly or incompletely trained \acp{CNN}, but it still increases the prediction accuracy even when extensively trained \acp{CNN} are used.
However, implementing three \acp{CNN} is very resource intensive; each has to be trained separately to a suitable standard and on different data, each has to be implemented separately and each has to run separately.
This takes much more time, memory and processing power than implementing a single \ac{CNN} to classify the input images.
The \ac{MNN} used more than three times the resources that a single \ac{CNN} would use, but it can be argued that this trade-off is worth the increase in classification accuracy where human lives are concerned.

The second technique showed the largest increase in the systems safety, with less resources required to implement it.
The runtime enforcer increased the prediction accuracy by 45\% for an extensively trained \ac{MNN}, which is a large improvement compared to the improvement from the \acp{MNN} ensembles alone. 
The biggest downside to the runtime enforcer is that is uses three different \acp{MNN} to run.
Each \ac{MNN} is an ensemble of \acp{CNN}, as introduced previously.
This means that using the runtime enforcer increases the resource usage of the system by 300\%.
However, the trade-off for the safety of the system, unlike the previous technique, is well worth the extra resource cost.
