\section{A Object Detection Case Study for Perturbed Inputs}
\acfp{AV} are quickly growing, companies such as Uber and Tesla the biggest contributors to this field.


\subsection{Object Misclassification in Autonomous Vehicle Systems}
Describe what sort of object are misclassified, some examples of issues with misclassifications (Uber, etc) and why these occur.

\subsection{Simulation of an Autonomous Vehicle Object Detection System}
We simulated an AV object detection system.
How close is it to the original and why we simulated what we did.
