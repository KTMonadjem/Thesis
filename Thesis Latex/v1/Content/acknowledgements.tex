\begin{abstract}
	Firstly, I would like to express my very great appreciation to my supervisor, Dr. Partha S. Roop. 
	He expended a lot of time and a lot of effort to get me to the point where I am now, and I am exceedingly grateful for that.
	He guided me through the tenure of my thesis, showing me what needed to be done, but not doing it for me.
	I learned many new and interesting concepts and technologies while working with him and was able to produce a great thesis with original work.
	
	Second is Mr. Hammond Pearce. 
	I am very thankful for the help from Mr. Hammond Pearce, PhD student at the University of Auckland.
	He took the role as a secondary supervisor to me, even with his own work as a PhD student.
	He helped me many a time when I was stuck, had a question or needed a push in the right direction.
	
	Next is the EECE group from the University of Auckland. 
	Many thanks to Dr. Matthew Kuo, Mr. Nathan Allen and Mr. Jin Ro.
	All three gentlemen helped me numerous times during my time as a ME student.
	
	A thanks to Mr. Yash Raje, who was a great lab partner and someone I spent a lot of time working with.
	
	Without Mr. Marc Katzef, University of Canterbury, I would not have been able to use the extremely well made MNN2C tool.
	He did a really great job creating it in his time spent at the University of Auckland, and I would like to thank him for his fantastic work.
	
	Finally, I wish to thank my family; my mom, my dad, my stepmom, my aunt, my brothers, and last, but not least, a friend of many years. 
	They all supported me throughout this degree and gave me the love and encouragement I needed.
