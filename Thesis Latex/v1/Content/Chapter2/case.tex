\section{A Case Study for Safe Synchronous Neural Networks}
This is the created AV system with runtime enforcement.

\subsection{Autonomous Vehicles}
What are AVs, where are they used, why are they dangerous?

\subsection{Safety Autonomous Vehicle Systems}
How is this system unsafe? What did it do to make it unsafe.

\subsection{Runtime Enforcement of Autonomous Vehicles Systems}
Where can RTE be introduced to AV systems. What are its limitations? 
Where does our work take RTE of this system.

\subsection{Architecture of an Autonomous Vehicle Simulation}
We created a simulation of an AV system.
What was done to ensure they were as similar as possible.

\subsection{Safety Policy for an Autonomous Vehicle Simulation}
The enforced safety policy for the above system.
