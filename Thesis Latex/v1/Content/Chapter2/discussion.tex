\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we have presented an approach for synchronous composition of runtime enforcement with \acfp{ANN} for safety critical systems.
Our \acfp{SNN} demonstrate that policies specifying safe I/O behaviours for \acp{ANN} can be enforced.
This means that their systems can behave in a verifiably safer way.
Our enforcement mechanism, in the three case studies presented, added an average overhead of just 6.035\%.

\subsection{Future Work}

\acp{SANN} supported the concept of meta neural networks, which were synchronous compositions of neural networks. 
In this work, we did not fully examine the enforcement of multiple networks in a meta-neural network (i.e. each network with its own enforcer).
Rather, only our controller networks were \acp{SNN}.
Examining compositions of synchronous neural networks with their enforcers could lead to more capable systems that are still safe.
