\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we have presented an approach for synchronous composition of \acf{RE} with \acfp{ANN} for \acp{CPS} by defining \acfp{SNN}.
Our \acp{SNN} demonstrate that policies specifying safe I/O behaviours for \acp{ANN} can be enforced.
These enforced policies are shown to increase the safety and efficiency of the systems within which they are placed, without adding a large overhead to the system and without decreasing the functionality of the system.
In the three case studies presented, the \ac{RE} added an average overhead of just 6.035\%, but the efficiency and safety of each system was increased by an amount that rendered the overhead negligible.
