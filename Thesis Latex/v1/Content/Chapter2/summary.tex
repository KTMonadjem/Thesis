\section{Summary}
This chapter introduces the concept of \acf{RE} in combination with \acf{SANN}.
To facilitate this concept, the previously defined \acfp{MNN} in Chapter 3 are expanded to include non-\ac{ANN} components, such as run-time enforcers.
These new \acp{MNN} are termed \acfp{SNN}.

The first two sections cover the introduction and related work respectively, providing a case for the use of \ac{RE} in systems with \ac{ANN} in the controllers.

The next section covers the case study used in this chapter.
An \acf{AV} system was designed and implemented for the purposes of the case study.
\acp{AV} currently have a large influence on the autonomous industry, and being \acfp{CPS}, have relevance in this chapter.

Section~\ref{sec:definitions} covers the formal definitions for the new (or updated) formal models introduced in this chapter, most prominently the \acfp{VDTA} used for the \ac{RE} and the expanded \ac{MNN} definition: \acp{SNN}.
These definitions are provided completely, with relevant examples given for each definition.

The last section presents the benchmark and case study results and shows the efficacy of this approach.
