\section{Summary}
This chapter introduces the concept of \acf{RE} in combination with \acf{SANN}.
To facilitate this concept, the previously defined \acfp{MNN} in Chapter 3 are expanded to include non-\ac{ANN} components, such as \acp{RE}.
These are termed \acfp{SNN}.

Sections~\ref{sec:intro} and \ref{sec:related} cover the introduction and related work respectively, providing a case for the use of \ac{RE} in systems with \ac{ANN} in the controllers.

Section~\ref{sec:case} covers the case study used in this chapter.
An \acf{AV} system was chosen to be used as the case study.
\acp{AV} currently have a large influence on the autonomous industry, and being \acfp{CPS}, have relevance in this chapter.

Section~\ref{sec:definitions} covers the definitions for the new formal models introduced in this chapter, most prominently the \acfp{VDTA} used for \ac{RE} and the \acp{SNN} using \ac{RE}.

The last section presents the benchmark results and shows the efficacy of this approach.
