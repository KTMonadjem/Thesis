\section{Summary}
This chapter introduces the concept of \acf{RE} in combination with \acf{SNN}.
To facilitate this concept, previously defined \acf{DTA}~\cite{recps} are expanded to include valued safety properties.
An \ac{AV} case study is created to show the efficacy of this approach.

The first two sections cover the introduction and related work respectively, providing a case for the use of \ac{RE} in systems with \ac{ANN} in the controllers.

The next section covers the case study used in this chapter.
An \acf{AV} system was designed and implemented for the purposes of the case study.

Section~\ref{sec:definitions} covers the formal definitions for the \ac{VDTA} introduced in this chapter.
These definitions are provided completely, with relevant examples given.

The last section presents the benchmark and case study results and shows the efficacy of this approach.
