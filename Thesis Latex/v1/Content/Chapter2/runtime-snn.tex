\section{Runtime Enforcement of Synchronous Neural Networks}
Section showing how we are using RTE with SNNs.

\subsection{Safe Synchronous Neural Networks}
Introduce the concept of combining SNNs and RTE to create a safe SNN

\subsection{Semantics of Safe Synchronous Neural Networks}
SSNN formal semantics in detail?

\subsection{Safe Meta Neural Networks}
How does the use of RTE expand to MNNs?

\subsection{Semantics of Safe Meta Neural Networks}
SMNN formal semantics in detail?

\subsection{Timing of Safe Synchronous Neural Networks}
Briefly discuss how these can be timed, etc.
