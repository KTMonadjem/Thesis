\section{Artificial Neural Networks}
\subsection{Machine Learning}
\acp{ANN} were originally proposed to mimic the functioning of  biological neural networks~\cite{kohonen1988introduction}, which produce recurrent spatio temporal patterns~\cite{rolston2007precisely}. 
Similar timed activity of neurons in the cerebellum has been reported in~\cite{bullock1994neural, moore1989adaptively}. 
A number of types of \ac{NN} which mimic their biological counterparts exist, varying in complexity and accuracy, including the \ac{SNN}~\cite{izhikevich2003spiking,maass1997spiking}, which was designed to model the brain and has been demonstrated to be periodic and run with discrete time intervals when implemented in software. 

\subsection{Structure of an Artificial Neural Network}
Most \acp{ANN} do not feature such complex models like those of spiking neural networks, as they are more difficult to use, implement, and train. 
Instead, they rely on simpler networks, which can be considered as \emph{un-timed non-linear} functions, where the outputs change relative to the inputs, but the timing of the change is not precisely defined. 
An example of such a network is provided in Figure~\ref{fig:mlp-ann}, which is using neurons defined in Figure~\ref{fig:artificial-neuron}. 
This is a type of \ac{NN} known as an \acf{MLP}~\cite{yegnanarayana1994artificial}.

Specialised neural networks, called \acfp{RNN}~\cite{medsker2001recurrent}, were introduced to classify temporal sequences. 
These operate in a step by step manner, where the operation in the current time step relies on the context from some previous step. Thus, \acp{RNN} may be viewed as a periodic networks, whosemperiod is one. 
However, the use of such networks in \ac{CPS} is yet to be thoroughly investigated. 
Moreover, \acp{RNN} and their compositions are not formalised especially from the point of view of designing timed AI systems used in \ac{CPS}.

\acp{ANN} are being increasingly used as controllers in \acp{CPS} due to their ability to learn data relationships in ways that are difficult to replicate~\cite{ANNSafety2007}. 
\acp{ANN} can deal with novel inputs to the system and are able to outperform other forms of \ac{AI} at computational efficiency, pattern recognition, function approximation and image identification~\cite{AIComp2016, AIComp2017}. 
However, it can be very difficult to ensure the safety of a system involving \acp{ANN}~\cite{ANNSafety2007, ANNSafety2018}.

\subsection{Safety of Artificial Neural Networks}
In order for an \ac{ANN} to be used in any capacity within a \acp{SCS}, it should undergo rigorous and thorough validation, verification, and testing procedures to ensure that they it is sufficiently safe for its target system~\cite{scann, ANNSafetyLifecycle2003}. 

While considerable research effort is starting in the direction of formal verification of \ac{AI}-based \ac{CPS}~\cite{seshia2016towards, russell2015}, the issue of timing verification has received scant attention. 
Like the challenges involving functional verification, timing verification of AI-based  \ac{CPS} poses considerable challenges due to: (1) real-time \ac{AI} systems could involve many concurrent and interacting \ac{AI} modules, which need deterministic composition for safety; (2) \ac{AI} modules are usually developed as untimed systems and the reactive nature of AI algorithms used in CPS are not carefully studied; and (3) \acf{WCET} analysis~\cite{wilhelm2008worst} of \ac{AI}-based \ac{CPS} has received scant attention.

Definitions for this safety vary, but Kurd et. al.~\cite{EstSafeCriteria2003} provide a generalisation: safe \acp{ANN} can be defined as those that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item tolerate faults and inconsistencies in their inputs,
	\item do not create hazardous outputs,
	\item behave in a predictable and repeatable manner,
	\item and are trained on clean, reliable data. 
\end{itemize}
%These properties are essential for an \ac{ANN} to run in any \ac{SCS}. 

To achieve these properties, there exist safety measures such as risk management systems that span the entire development process of the \ac{ANN}~\cite{ANNDevModel1999} and standards with which \acp{ANN} can be certified before they are used in \acp{SCS}~\cite{SCANNStandard}. 
These techniques are primarily \textit{proactive} in nature, producing \acp{ANN} that are classified as \textit{safe enough} for their role. 

However, as \acp{ANN} become larger and more full-featured, they  become harder to statically analyse.
Problematic situations can arise when an \ac{ANN} exhibits unexpected behaviour that the system is unable to safely respond to, and in \acp{SCS} these situations can be life threatening.
